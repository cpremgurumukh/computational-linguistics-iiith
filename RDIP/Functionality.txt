1) Types are the number of unique or unrepeated words that are present in a sentence
2) Tokens are the number of words that are present in a sentence 
3) After answering the number of tokens and types tokens and types box should be highlighted
4) If the submitted answer is correct then the answered box need to turn green and should print "Right answer"
5) If the submitted answer is wrong the answered box need to turn red and should print "Wrong answer"
6) If it is a wrong answer the user can know the answer if the text are highlighted based on tokens and types with different colours.
7) The paragraph or sentences should change randomly everytime we run the code
8) In order to avoid confusion in counting the number of types there need to be an option to highlight the repeated word.
9) The submit button need to check and give the answers of both number of types and tokens at the same time.
10)The website should always be simple and responsive
11)There should 3 different corpus available to the user
12)We have to use snowball stemmer to simulate this experiment
